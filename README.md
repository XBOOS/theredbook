The Redbook
===========

A survival guide for CS PhD students at Stanford. The Redbook is the attempt of
a few PHD students to pass on bits of wisdom and frank advice to newer students
in the hope that the next generation avoids their missteps. It lives online at
http://github.com/austenmc/theredbook.

Printing The Redbook is your duty to the next incoming class! Follow these
instructions and feel free to contact the historical editing team above if
you have problems.

Let xxxx be the current year.

1. Collect image asset files:
    * `xxxx/xxxx-redbook-halftitlepage.pdf`
    * `xxxx/xxxx-redbook-titlepage.pdf`
    * `xxxx/xxxx.redbook.jpg`
    * `xxxx/xxxx.redbook.spine.jpg`
    * `graphics/redbook.back.jpg`
    * Have we run out of these assets? Contact Austen
      <austen.mcdonald@gmail.com>.

2. Update the .tex file:
    * Update the .tex file to have the current year everywhere appropriate.
    * Update Section 6.2 regarding who supported the Redbook (likely the
      Computer Forum).
    * Send last year's PDF to Verna, Helen and Kristen in the CS PhD Office to
      proofread and let you know of any changes to CS Dept or Stanford
      University policies.
    * Ask for feedback on The Redbook from students in previous years (both
      first-years from the previous years and later-year students).
    * Be sure to keep the book short - its conciseness is one of its founding
      principles!

3. Compile the .tex file:
    * `pdflatex theredbook.tex`
    * `pdflatex theredbook.tex`
    * Yes, twice :)
